## Installation
To run the project, ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries. You can install the libraries using:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy scikit-learn
Modules Covered

1. Data Wrangling
Loaded the dataset and cleaned missing values in bedrooms and bathrooms by replacing them with the mean.
Dropped unnecessary columns (id and Unnamed: 0).
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
Counted houses with unique floor values.
Used box plots to analyze waterfront houses.
Performed correlation analysis to identify features most correlated with price.
3. Model Development
Built linear regression models:
Predicting price using individual features like sqft_living (R² = 0.49).
Using multiple features to predict price (R² = 0.66).
Created pipelines for polynomial regression and evaluated performance using Ridge Regression.
4. Model Evaluation and Refinement
Split data into training and testing sets.
Applied Ridge regression with second-order polynomial features, achieving an R² = 0.70.
Usage

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/king-county-house-sales.git
cd king-county-house-sales
Load the dataset: Download the dataset from the provided link or load it directly using:
df = pd.read_csv("kc_house_data_NaN.csv")
Run the analysis:
Use Jupyter Notebook or Python to execute the analysis.
Example commands:
Count houses with unique floor values:
df['floors'].value_counts().to_frame()
Box plot for price outliers:
sns.boxplot(x='waterfront', y='price', data=df)
Regression model with polynomial features:
RidgeModel1.fit(x_train_pr, y_train)
RidgeModel1.score(x_test_pr, y_test)
Results

Correlation Analysis:
Features most correlated with price:
sqft_living (0.70)
grade (0.66)
sqft_above (0.60)
Model Performance:
Simple Linear Regression (sqft_living): R² = 0.49
Multiple Linear Regression: R² = 0.66
Ridge Regression with Polynomial Features: R² = 0.70
Insights:
Houses with waterfront views tend to have more price outliers.
Larger sqft_living and higher grade strongly influence house prices.
